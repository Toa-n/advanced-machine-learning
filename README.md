# Advanced Machine Learning
This is a summary of the lecture **Advanced Machine Learning** (summer semester 2025) at the RWTH Aachen.

The summary divides the lecture into the following topics:
- **Linear Regression**: Regularization, MLE, MAP, Bayes Curve Fitting
- **Graphical Model**: Bayesian Networks, MRFs
- **Approximate Inference**: Sampling, MCMC
- **Latent Variable Models**: GMM, EM, conjugate priors
- **Generative Models**: GAN, VAE, Diffusion

The Markdown files are formatted to work with [Markmap](https://markmap.js.org/), a mind map visualizer, which is available as a VSCode extension.

Exported HTML files of the mind maps are also available and can also be viewed [here](https://toa-n.github.io/advanced-machine-learning/).
